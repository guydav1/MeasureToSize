# Measure To Size

The goal of this app is to take any picture with a knows length of a section, and allow you to measure it according to that scale.
Future goals were also to be able to get the scale using a known area, and also print the picture in a 1:1 scale.
## Run
Run using JRE 12 +

This is a work in progress (That probably will not continue).
